# step1-> install apache2:
sudo apt install apache2 -y
check status: 
	sudo ufw status
enable the status:
	sudo ufw enable
	
sever status:
	service apache2 status
allow all request to appache2:	
	sudo ufw app list
	sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"
<br>
 
# step3-> install mysql:
	sudo apt install mysql-server -y
enter to mysql: 
	sudo mysql
now we can run database commands like 
	>show databases;
now exit from mysql promt:
	>exit	

## need to create user and set pass letter after php install	

<br>
 
# step3-> install PHP: 
	sudo apt install php php-mysql libapache2-mod-php -y
check vertion:
	php -v
	
# give read and write permission to a folder:
	sudo chown -R $USER:USER /var/www/folder
# give file create: cd to the directory and type
	touch ~/Templates/Empty Document
	
# install phpMyAdmin
	sudo apt install php-mbstring php-zip ph-gd php-curl php-json -y
	sudo apt install phpmyadmin -y  

<hr>

if there is any access issue then abourt the installation and enter to mysql promt at terminal and run commands: 
1. update mysql.user set plugin = 'mysql_native_password' where User='root';
2. FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
3. exit;	
<hr>
	
set password for phpmyadmin: phpmyadmin
	sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Now set pass for mysql root user
	sudo mysql
  see all user with pass:
  > SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
  
  set password: (pass: password)
   ALTER USER ‘root’@‘localhost’ IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY ‘password’;
Now we will see pass for root by typing:
   SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
Now exit from mysql promt
   exit

# enter to mysql after password setting:
	sudo mysql -p
	
# create new user for mysql
	sudo mysql -p
  inside myql promt:
  > create user 'userName'@'localhost' identified with caching_sh2_password by 'password';
Now we will see pass for new created user by typing:
  >SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
Now we need to give privilages to this user 
  > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO ‘userName’@‘localhost’ WITH GRANT OPTION;	
  
Now exit from mysql promt
   exit
   
Once again
 sudo systemctl restart apache2
 sudo systemctl restart mysql

<hr>
	
# NOW filnally:

PHP My Admin:
	userName: phpmyadmin
	pass : phpmyadmin
mysql users:
	1: 
	 user name: root
	 pass: password
	2: 
	 user name: userName
	 pass: password
	 
<hr>	 
		
# Enter to the phpmyadmin: localhost/phpmyadmin
	enter through new user:
		user name: userName
	 	pass: password
